        <p>
            Years ago, most software applications were big monoliths, running either as a single
            process or as a small number of processes spread across a handful of servers. These
            legacy systems are still widespread today. They have slow release cycles and are
            updated relatively infrequently. At the end of every release cycle, developers pack-
            age up the whole system and hand it over to the ops team, who then deploys and
            monitors it. In case of hardware failures, the ops team manually migrates it to the
            remaining healthy servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, these big monolithic legacy applications are slowly being broken down
            into smaller, independently running components called microservices. Because microservices are decoupled from each other, they can be developed, deployed, updated,
            and scaled individually. This enables you to change components quickly and as often as
            necessary to keep up with today’s rapidly changing business requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            But with bigger numbers of deployable components and increasingly larger data-
            centers, it becomes increasingly difficult to configure, manage, and keep the whole
            system running smoothly. It’s much harder to figure out where to put each of those
            components to achieve high resource utilization and thereby keep the hardware costs
            down. Doing all this manually is hard work. We need automation, which includes
            automatic scheduling of those components to our servers, automatic configuration,
            supervision, and failure-handling. This is where Kubernetes comes in.
        </p>
        <p> Kubernetes enables developers to deploy their applications themselves and as
            often as they want, without requiring any assistance from the operations (ops) team.
            But Kubernetes doesn’t benefit only developers. It also helps the ops team by automat-
            ically monitoring and rescheduling those apps in the event of a hardware failure. The
            focus for system administrators (sysadmins) shifts from supervising individual apps to
            mostly supervising and managing Kubernetes and the rest of the infrastructure, while
            Kubernetes itself takes care of the apps.
        </p>
        <div>NOTE Kubernetes is Greek for pilot or helmsman (the person holding the
            ship’s steering wheel). People pronounce Kubernetes in a few different ways.
            Many pronounce it as Koo-ber-nay-tace, while others pronounce it more like
            Koo-ber-netties. No matter which form you use, people will understand what
            you mean.
        </div>
        <p> Kubernetes abstracts away the hardware infrastructure and exposes your whole data-
            center as a single enormous computational resource. It allows you to deploy and run
            your software components without having to know about the actual servers under-
            neath. When deploying a multi-component application through Kubernetes, it selects
            a server for each component, deploys it, and enables it to easily find and communi-
            cate with all the other components of your application.
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes Kubernetes great for most on-premises datacenters, but where it starts
            to shine is when it’s used in the largest datacenters, such as the ones built and oper-
            ated by cloud providers. Kubernetes allows them to offer developers a simple platform
            for deploying and running any type of application, while not requiring the cloud pro-
            vider’s own sysadmins to know anything about the tens of thousands of apps running
            on their hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            With more and more big companies accepting the Kubernetes model as the best
            way to run apps, it’s becoming the standard way of running distributed apps both in
            the cloud, as well as on local on-premises infrastructure.
